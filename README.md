## Project Description
In this project I wrote down a version of the games:
1. Guess where is the ball \\
2. TicTacToe



## Workflow
In this project were applied most of the concepts cover in the lectures. \\

The following steps were followed to code the TicTacToe game that
were based in the ones used for "Guess where is the ball" game. The idea
was start from basic ideas and expand them  as much as possible, I tried
to apply the basic  concepts of python (list, functions, loops,etc.)in
a good manner, the code was wrote as clear as I can until now.
There is also another folder with other two games in which the same
concepts are used in a different way.


Step 1: Write a function that can print out a board. Set up your board as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad, so you get a 3 by 3 board representation. \\
Step 2: Write a function that can take in a player input and assign their marker as 'X' or 'O'. Think about using while loops to continually ask until you get a correct answer.\\

Step 3: Write a function that takes in the board list object, a marker ('X' or 'O'), and a desired position (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.\\

Step 4: Write a function that takes in a board and a mark (X or O) and then checks to see if that mark has won. \\

Step 5: Write a function that uses the random module to randomly decide which player goes first. You may want to lookup random.randint() Return a string of which player went first.\\

Step 6: Write a function that returns a boolean indicating whether a space on the board is freely available.\\

Step 7: Write a function that checks if the board is full and returns a boolean value. True if full, False otherwise.\\

Step 8: Write a function that asks for a player's next position (as a number 1-9) and then uses the function from step 6 to check if it's a free position. If it is, then return the position for later use.

Step 9: Write a function that asks the player if they want to play again and returns a boolean True if they do want to play again.\\

Step 10: Combine all the above functions  to run the game!
